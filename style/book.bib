  abstract = {Chenopodium quinoa Willd. is a pseudocereal that has been cultivated in the Andean region for thousands of years. It is an annual broad-leaved plant, 1\textendash{}2m tall with deep penetrating roots and can be cultivated from sea level upto an altitude of 3800m. The plant shows tolerance to frost, salinity and drought, and has the ability to grow on marginal soils. Quinoa grain is highly nutritious due to its outstanding protein quality and wide range of minerals and vitamins. The grain protein is rich in amino acids like lysine and methionine that are deficient in cereals. The grain is used to make flour, soup, breakfast, cereal and alcohol, while the flour is utilized in making biscuits, bread and processed food. Quinoa starch having small grains and high viscosity, can be exploited for various industrial applications. The crop is self-pollinated with low outcrossing rates. Emasculation and hybridization are cumbersome due to small size of the flowers, but male sterility in some cultivars and gynomonoecious breeding system may help breeding research in this crop. Quinoa's ability to produce high-protein grains under ecologically extreme conditions makes it important for the diversification of future agricultural systems, especially in high-altitude area of the Himalayas and North Indian Plains.},

  abstract = {Quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa Willd., is an Amaranthacean, stress-tolerant plant cultivated along the Andes for the last 7000 years, challenging highly different environmental conditions ranging from Bolivia, up to 4.500 m of altitude, to sea level, in Chile. Its grains have higher nutritive value than traditional cereals and it is a promising worldwide cultivar for human consumption and nutrition. The quinoa has been called a pseudo-cereal for botanical reasons but also because of its unusual composition and exceptional balance between oil, protein and fat. The quinoa is an excellent example of `functional food' that aims at lowering the risk of various diseases. Functional properties are given also by minerals, vitamins, fatty acids and antioxidants that can make a strong contribution to human nutrition, particularly to protect cell membranes, with proven good results in brain neuronal functions. Its minerals work as cofactors in antioxidant enzymes, adding higher value to its rich proteins. Quinoa also contains phytohormones, which offer an advantage over other plant foods for human nutrition. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 Society of Chemical Industry},

The total amount of phenolic acids varied from 16.8 to 59.7mg/100g and the proportion of soluble phenolic acids varied from 7\% to 61\%. The phenolic acid content in Andean crops was low compared with common cereals like wheat and rye, but was similar to levels found in oat, barley, corn and rice. The flavonoid content of quinoa and ka{\~n}iwa was exceptionally high, varying from 36.2 to 144.3mg/100g. Kiwicha did not contain quantifiable amounts of these compounds. Only one variety of kiwicha contained low amounts of betalains. These compounds were not detected in ka{\~n}iwa or quinoa. Our study demonstrates that Andean indigenous crops have excellent potential as sources of health-promoting bioactive compounds such as flavonoids.},

  title = {Chenopodium},
  isbn = {978-3-642-14387-8},
  abstract = {The genus Chenopodium L. has a worldwide distribution and includes species that were domesticated on four continents. Several species are notorious as invasive weeds, having spread far beyond their centers of origin. Among the wild species are some that are common and others that are restricted to niche environments, appearing ephemerally in response to episodically favorable climatic conditions. Chenopodium inhabits niches that include some of the harshest environments on earth for plant survival. The ability of Chenopodium species to survive in saline littoral and saltpan environments, high-ultraviolet montane plains and valleys (Andes, Himalayas), and barren deserts (Atacama, Australia) suggests that this genus possesses unusually potent and diverse plant stress-response mechanisms. The domesticated species are becoming increasingly valued for the balanced content of dietary essential amino acids in their seed proteins and for the rich mineral and vitamin content of their foliage. The genus has been recalcitrant to thorough systematic and phylogenetic study due to phenotypic plasticity in several major species (most notably C. album), confused taxonomy in closely related genera (especially Atriplex and Dysphania), as well as the sporadic and unpredictable appearance of a number of key annuals. Genetically, the genus has a base chromosome number of x = 9 with numerous polyploids up to the level of hexaploidy. We herein review the wild Chenopodium species, with special emphasis on those of the Americas that should be most closely related to Andean quinoa (C. quinoa) and its domesticated cousins from Mexico (C. berlandieri nuttaliae); a small number of studies on interspecies crossability; and potential characteristics of interest in the wild species for improving the domesticated quinoas.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {0363-6445},
  abstract = {The taxonomic significance of those morphological characters that have been used to delimit Chenopodium sect. Chenopodium subsect. Cellulata has been questioned. Species of this alveolate-fruited group are therefore often not treated in regional manuals, especially those covering the eastern United States. Alveolate-fruited species usually are included with the synonymy of C. album s. lat. of subsect. Leiosperma. The validity of subsect. Cellulata was tested through two programs of artificial hybridization. Results support the circumscription of subsect. Cellulata as a unit distinct from other elements of sect. Chenopodium. Hybridization between taxa within subsect. Cellulata produced viable F\textsubscript{1} plants, whereas intersubsectional crosses resulted in inviable hybrids or none at all. Chenopodium bushianum, an alveolate-fruited species of northeastern North America that is often confused with C. album, showed complete genomic compatibility with C. berlandieri subsp. berlandieri, a common alveolate-fruited weed of western North America. This, plus the presence of apparent intergrading populations in the area of sympatry, indicates that the two might be better treated as a single species. When morphological, cytological, and hybridization data are considered, all taxa of the Cellulata complex appear to constitute a relatively coherent group that is well removed from C. album and related species of subsect. Leiosperma. Hybridization data also indicate the presence of a "restorer factor" for cytoplasmically inherited male-sterility in C. quinoa. This factor appears to be present in some strains of C. quinoa subsp. quinoa and some strains of C. berlandieri subsp. berlandieri.},

  title = {Simulation of {{Chenopodium}} Album Seedling Emergence},
  volume = {48},
  issn = {0043-1745, 1550-2759},
  abstract = {Studies were conducted to develop a model from field and laboratory studies to predict the emergence phenology of Chenopodium album. A mechanistic model to predict the phenology of weed seedling emergence across locations, years, and tillage systems is presented. This was accomplished by the integration of hydrothermal time to describe germination and thermal time to describe shoot elongation. The interaction of soil moisture and temperature in the model was accounted for by the integration of hydrothermal time in algorithms predicting seed germination. Soil temperatures within the weed seed germination zone were predicted by temperature ranges at different depths in the soil. Emergence phenology of C. album seedlings was predicted with greater accuracy under no-till and moldboard plow systems than under a chisel plow system. We attributed this lower accuracy in the chisel plow system to increased heterogeneity in the soil matrix and vertical distribution of the seedbank caused by the chisel plow. The presence or absence of Zea mays did not affect model performance. The use of soil temperature to calculate thermal time was a better predictor of C. album seedling emergence than air temperature. The ability to predict weed seedling emergence phenology is an important component of an integrated weed management strategy.},
